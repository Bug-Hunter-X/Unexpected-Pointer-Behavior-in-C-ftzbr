# Unexpected Pointer Behavior in C

This repository demonstrates a basic example of pointer arithmetic in C. While the code is correct and functions as expected, it highlights a potential source of confusion for programmers new to pointers.

The `bug.c` file contains a simple program that uses a pointer to modify the value of an integer variable. The `bugSolution.c` file offers an improved version (though functionally the same). 

**Key Learning Points:**
* Understanding how pointers work and dereferencing.
* The difference between the value of a variable and the address held by a pointer.
* The importance of understanding pointer arithmetic to avoid unexpected behavior
